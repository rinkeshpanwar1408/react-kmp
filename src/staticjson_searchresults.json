The Infosys team stepped up to the challenge and helped this company achieve their <b>modern</b> workplace goals effectively, by leveraging Microsoft’s Unified Endpoint Management technologies.Key ChallengesTedious manual provisioning processes for new Windows devicesDisruption of day-to-day activities during migrationLoss of user data during deploymentConsistent employee experience across geographiesThe SolutionTransitioning from legacy software to a <b>modern</b> collaborative ecosystemStarting with stakeholder engagement through to incident management and hyper care while being backed by the plethora of offerings under Infosys Cobalt, we guided the beverage and brewing company through a well-structured change management strategy. The migration comprised of installing Microsoft Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus across the board for users using 5000+ devices.What did we do?To push the new Microsoft Windows 10 system software to all the devices, a new SCCM environment was built and the Infosys team orchestrated the image creation for various hardware models.At the rate of 35-40 machines a day, the applications were delivered to the client machines through Microsoft Endpoint Manager – SCCM, Azure Active Directory, and Microsoft Intune – along with some of Infosys’ indigenous automation tools to accelerate the upgrade.To ensure zero loss of user data, a thorough deployment checklist was maintained, and Microsoft USMT was used. Further, as part of the domain standardization initiative, the Infosys team utilized an in-house tool built on PowerShell to replace multiple domains with one universal domain.Local-language-speaking engineers were also deployed at respective locations to enhance the user experience during the upgrade.Case StudyMeticulous planning and strategizing helps deliver enriched employee experienceImprove process efficiencies with a robust technical solutionEnhance user experience with a structured deployment strategyMicro-managed project plans help handle a large user base across geographiesA robust change management strategy prepares end users before the upgrade and provide transition and adoption support after the upgradeBenefitsA secure, <b>modern</b> workplace with better employee engagementAutomated and user-friendly cloud-based technology for deploying 5000+ Windows devices to eliminate the need for re-imaging new devices manuallyA detailed deployment strategy and plan that tracked the scheduling and completion for every end user ensuring minimal downtimeEnsured zero loss of user data with domain standardization initiativesImproved experience through multi-lingual support for users in ~40 locations across 8 countries in 4 different languages",

Infosys leveraged its experience with JD Edwards upgrades for a predictable, retrofitted solution implementation that ensured minimal business downtime.As part of the upgrade process, the Infosys team performed objects prioritization, code retrofitting, unit testing, performance testing, assisted in functional, system integration and user acceptance testing, dress rehearsals. They provided an out-of-box data conversion optimization service and also coordinated product issues with Oracle to complete the upgrade as per the schedule.Zero-defect platform for business continuityInfosys migrated Fletcher custom code with a very low defect count, resulting in a lower testing effort, and no critical defects during hyper-care.Infosys obtained over 1400% optimization to data conversion scripts to migrate the largest database from 20 days duration to 1 hour through optimized native database tools. This enabled Fletcher to comfortably stay within the cutover window.With the successful upgrade to JD Edwards 9.2, Fletcher now benefits from a “Continuous Innovation Delivery Model”. Improvements in functionality are now delivered as a constant stream of small updates, obviating the need for future risky significant upgrades.Case StudyZero-defect platform for business continuityInfosys migrated Fletcher custom code with a very low defect count, resulting in a lower testing effort, and no critical defects during hyper-care.Infosys obtained over 1400% optimization to data conversion scripts to migrate the largest database from 20 days duration to 1 hour through optimized native database tools.
