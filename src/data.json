The interface was intuitive, consumer grade, and enabled self-service across all devices including mobile phones. The solution also introduced country-specific features such as public holiday calendars, accrual rules, and country-specific fields and business rules to help the client manage their multi-ethnic workforce on a single platform.Harmonized, optimized, and transformed absence and attendance processesAdopted <b>SAP</b> best practices during process standardizationIntroduced agile framework and pod structure to build the solution based on <b>SAP</b> Activate methodology using DevOpsIncorporated country-specific validations to cater to local requirementsLeveraged Online Report Designer (ORD) reports to gather absence, overtime, and allowance data for payroll processingCase StudyHarmonized, optimized, and transformed absence and attendance processesAdopted <b>SAP</b> best practices during process standardizationIntroduced agile framework and pod structure to build the solution based on <b>SAP</b> Activate methodology using DevOpsIncorporated country-specific validations to cater to local requirementsLeveraged Online Report Designer (ORD) reports to gather absence, overtime, and allowance data for payroll processingBenefitsReduced the total cost of ownership by replacing outdated disparate legacy applications with one global solution based on EC Time Off and Time SheetImproved the user experience by implementing next generation consumer grade user interface across all devices including mobile phonesImproved efficiencies in HR processes and increased overall productivity by introducing automation and enabling self-service capabilities",

This included demand planning, supply planning, and integration with execution systems – <b>SAP</b> ECC and legacy. The platform was further enhanced to address specific challenges faced by each business unit. For instance, for the surgical business unit, several business-specific requirements were identified and implemented as part of the Surgical Push Deployment Project.A combination of unconstrained and constrained supply planning (using heuristics and optimizer engines) ensured effective distribution planningCustomized controls on safety stock prevented stock-outs for supply-constrained productsUsed multi-level shelf-life planning for deployment based on unusable and expiring inventory batches across countries and distribution centersLeveraged the ‘demand categorization’ functionality to prioritize backorders over future sales orders while determining the quantity to be deployedIntegrated deployment signals with the execution system to trigger outbound shipments from the manufacturing plants or main distribution centers to different shipping pointsCase StudyA combination of unconstrained and constrained supply planning (using heuristics and optimizer engines) ensured effective distribution planningCustomized controls on safety stock prevented stock-outs for supply-constrained productsUsed multi-level shelf-life planning for deployment based on unusable and expiring inventory batches across countries and distribution centersLeveraged the ‘demand categorization’ functionality to prioritize backorders over future sales orders while determining the quantity to be deployedIntegrated deployment signals with the execution system to trigger outbound shipments from the manufacturing plants or main distribution centers to different shipping pointsBenefitsImproved inventory management and reduced obsolescence by automating shelf-life managementEnabled envisioning and meeting future customer demand by effectively managing supply and capacity considerationsEnsured effective allocation of inventory across the supply chain based on prioritization of customer ordersImproved control on stock deployment, thereby reducing stock-outs for supply-constrained productsReduced manual effort by integrating planning results with execution systems",
